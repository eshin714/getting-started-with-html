  <b> THE BASICS OF THE WEB AND HTML</b>

<p>The WORLD WIDE WEB is made up of a collection HTML. You could say its a web of HTML. There are over 30 billion HTML links on the internet.
</p>

<p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language which can be made up of 4 parts. The first is text content, which is what you see. The second is mark up, which is what it looks like. The third are references, which  other documents such as images and videos. The last is links, which are "links" to other pages.
</p>

<b>HTML ATTRIBUTES and TAGS!</b>

<p>
Attributes always equal a value and they can have multiple attributes.
  <br>
  <br>I created this tag with a "anchor" tag. This "a" or "anchor" tag enables you to define a <b>hyperlink</b>.
  for example Here is a <a href = "www.reddit.com">website</a>.
</p>

<p>  
  Here is a <b>image</b> tag.<br>
  "img" tags can embed images into HTML through a type of link.

  Here is an example of an image

  <img src="http://jokideo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Funny-cat-meme-Cake.jpg" alt="funny cat picture!">
</p>
<p>  
  Bold Tag - Bolds words within in the tag
  for example <b> I just bolded this statement with the bold tag </b>
</p>

<p>
  Emphasis tag - This tag emphasizes or italicizes 
 for example <em> Whoa, I am cool.</em>
</p>

<p>
Span tag - This tag spans two lines into one line.
  <br>
  ex:
<br>
  <span>this is one line</span>
  Hell yea, one line.
<br>
 <br>
Div tag - This tag divides lines.
<div>This is one line.</div>
Nope, two lines.
